								<h2>The problem...
								</h2>
							</header>
							<p>In their seminal work <i>Biophilic Design: The Theory, Science, and Practice of Bringing Buildings to Life</i> (2008), Stephen R. Kellert, and Judith Heerwagen, and Martin Mador explore how integrating natural elements into architectural design can enhance human well-being and productivity: "We will never be truly healthy, satisfied, or fulfilled if we live apart and alienated from the environment from which we evolved".</p>
							<p>Johnson Controls helps office buildings become greener in terms of energy efficiency, but what if we could help them become greener in a more literal sense as well? Modern offices now have green walls, green external envelopes, green dividers, green ceilings, and more plants than ever before. However, building management systems do not take plants into account when delivering clean air to building spaces, even though plants are miniature filtration systems. Furthermore, enterprise management systems do not take office plants into account in their sustainability metrics.</p>

								<h2>The solution...
								</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								What is the most effective way to make the building aware of the plants within it, without costly sensors in each plant or time-consuming in person visits?</p> <p>Office Forests builds on the OpenBlue Companion app to gather this data through images. 
								An optional prompt within the app suggests building occupants photo a tree near their desk. The location of the image is noted automatically on the Companion floor and the plant is identified through a computer vision model. The user gets information on the plant type, origin, and health benefits, while
								the location and identification are shared with OpenBlue Enterprise Manager, which over time builds up a database of the plants within a building. This data enriches the building's sustainability metrics and can also be shared with BMS systems, which can make adjustments to air turnover based on the assumption that trees remove CO<sub>2</sub> at defined rates.

								<h2>Peace Lily</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The peace lily (Spathiphyllum) is a popular plant known for its elegant white flowers and lush green leaves. It originates from the tropical rainforests of Central and South America, where it thrives in the warm, humid environment. Peace lilies are not only beautiful but also excellent air purifiers, making them a favorite choice for indoor gardening. </p>
							<ul>
								<li>    Air Purification: Peace lilies are excellent at removing harmful toxins such as formaldehyde, benzene, and trichloroethylene from the air, which can improve indoor air quality and reduce symptoms like headaches and respiratory issues.</li>
									
								<li>	Humidity Regulation: Peace lilies help maintain optimal humidity levels by releasing moisture into the air. This can prevent dry skin and respiratory problems, making the office environment more comfortable12.</li>
								
								<li>    Care: Prefers indirect light and consistently moist soil.</li>
